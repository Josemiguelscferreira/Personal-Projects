Welcome to BugMan!

BugMan was a group project developed during the 4th week of the Code For All Full Stack Bootcamp, on our 3rd week learning Java.

Our game is inspired by the classic game pacman, implementing the theme of our bootcamp with the classroom for the game map, our computers to be destroyed by the bug and our code masters as ghosts, trying to capture the bug! As BugMan, your mission is to destroy all the computers within the time limit without being caught by the code masters.

Here are the instructions:
